# dotfiles

This repository for my Linux dot files.

*I use Arch Linux.*

I install Manjaro Linux first, I thought some of the configuration was good, so I kept some configuration files.

Then I switched to Arch Linux, I think it's more suitable for me.

Because I pushed the repository in a very short time, It may have many unreasonable points, which I will correct later.

The  vim configuration in my other [repository](https://github.com/zichenstudio/vimrc) will be updated to this repository.
